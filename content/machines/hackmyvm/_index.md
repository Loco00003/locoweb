#### Machines created by the community of [hackmyvm](https://hackmyvm.eu), a free platform where either aspiring or seasoned ethical hackers submit machines for others solve, besides the machines, it also has labs, where the user logs in via SSH to a domain owned by the platform and collects flags, which are used for advancing through the levels available in the lab. Besides that, it has a leaderboard to encourage competition between hackers. Very good site to start practicing ethical hacking.
