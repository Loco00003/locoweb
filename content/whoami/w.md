Since my earliest memory, I've been involved with computers, either in gaming, or in productivity. Since 2021 or earlier, I took interest in the area of cybersecurity, but didn't start concretly until December of 2023. Now, my objective is, with the help resources all around the web to learn about this area and , maybe work in it as a pentester.

This blog will serve as a log of practice machines from different platforms, in those posts, the information includes but not limited too:
-   Information abour the machine (Difficulty, plataform of origin, operating system, difficulty, etc).
-   Step by step thought process while I was trying to solve machine
-   Things I learned from the machine

I you've read through some of my writeups or something of my page, thanks for your time!
